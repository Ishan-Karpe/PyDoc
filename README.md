# PyDoc: Simple document editor. 
### Will be enhanced soon

If you don't know who I am, my name is Ishan. I am a teenager who is a PCAP certified programmer, who is now coding unique projects so that I can learn how to write code efficiently in Python and make it understandable to ANYONE through my comments.

PyDoc is a document editor that is pretty basic and has been used before but this is my first time developing such technologies before I get into the big ones

Note:

Could you make sure to install tk using pip, or else it will error out?
